   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to:

- Removes consecutive underscores
- Removes leading/trailing underscores
- Example: `My Document (2023).pdf` â†’ `my_document_2023.txt`

## Technical Details

### Backend (Python Flask)
- **Framework**: Flask with CORS support
- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2 library for text extraction
- **File Handling**: Secure file upload with size and type validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with gradient backgrounds
- **File Management**: Drag & drop interface with file preview
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time conversion progress
- **Download Management**: Individual and batch download options

### API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Serve the main application
- `POST /convert` - Convert PDF to text
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## File Limitations

- **Maximum file size**: 16MB per PDF
- **Supported format**: PDF files only
- **Text extraction**: Works best with text-based PDFs (not scanned images)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No text could be extracted"**:
   - The PDF might be image-based or scanned
   - Try with a different PDF that contains selectable text

2. **"File too large"**:
   - Reduce the PDF file size or split large documents

3. **Server not starting**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check if port 5000 is available

4. **Conversion fails**:
   - Check the browser console for error messages
   - Ensure the PDF file is not corrupted

## Development

To run in development mode:
```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start with debug mode enabled and auto-reload on file changes.
